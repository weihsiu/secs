Hacking a minimum ECS in Scala 3

ECS (Entity Component System) is a well-known pattern in both the game engines and UI frameworks.
Scala 3, with its many new meta-programming features, are well-suited for ECS construction.
In this talk, I will present a minimum ECS by utilizing language features of Scala 3 and explain some of the intricacies of the implementation.
It should not be too difficult to follow along.
Skimming through the ECS article on Wikipedia might be beneficial prior to the talk.

By utilizing Scala's sophisticated type system, the ECS features, even though minimum, are both type-safe and user-friendly.
It is my belief that a good computer language should be able to minimize program mistakes and maximize program performance, and I think Scala 3 delivers on both promises splendidly.
