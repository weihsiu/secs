Hacking a minimum ECS in Scala 3
ECS (Entity Component System) is a well-known pattern in both the game engines and UI frameworks.
Scala 3, with its many new meta-programming features, are well-suited for ECS construction.
In this talk, I will present a minimum ECS by utilizing features of Scala 3 and explain some of the intricacies of the implementation.
By utilizing Scala's sophisticated type system, the ECS features, even though minimum, are both type-safe and user-friendly.
It is my belief that a computer language should be helpful wh
